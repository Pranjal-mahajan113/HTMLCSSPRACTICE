<!-- 1. flex-grow — “When there’s extra space, who gets it?”
Definition: Controls how much an item will grow relative to other items when there’s extra space in the container.

Default value: 0 (won’t grow at all unless told to).

Logic: Bigger number = more extra space taken.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
.item1 { flex-grow: 1; }
.item2 { flex-grow: 2; }
If extra space is 300px:

item1 gets 100px (1 part)

item2 gets 200px (2 parts)
Ratio = 1:2

Website usage:
If you want a sidebar and main content to fill the remaining width proportionally, flex-grow decides the share of the pie each gets.

2. flex-shrink — “When there’s not enough space, who sacrifices more?”
Definition: Controls how much an item will shrink relative to other items when the container is smaller than the total items.

Default value: 1 (all items shrink equally unless told otherwise).

Logic: Bigger number = shrinks more.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
.item1 { flex-shrink: 1; }
.item2 { flex-shrink: 3; }
If container shrinks by 200px:

item1 loses 50px

item2 loses 150px
Ratio = 1:3

Website usage:
If you want a logo in a navbar to shrink less than menu items on small screens, you’d give logo a smaller flex-shrink (like 0).

3. flex-basis — “What’s your starting size before growing/shrinking?”
Definition: The initial size of the flex item before any growing or shrinking happens.

Default value: auto (size based on content or width property).

Logic: Think of it as the “base size” before flex rules kick in.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
.item1 { flex-basis: 200px; }
.item2 { flex-basis: 100px; }
They start at those widths, and then grow/shrink as per the other two properties.

Website usage:
If you want cards to start at 250px width but still be responsive, you set flex-basis: 250px and then let grow/shrink adjust them.

4. The Magic Shortcut: flex
Instead of writing:

css
Copy
Edit
.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 0;
  flex-basis: 200px;
}
You can write:

css
Copy
Edit
.item {
  flex: 1 0 200px;
}
Format:
flex: <grow> <shrink> <basis>

How it works together (mental picture)
flex-basis: “I start at 200px.”

flex-grow: “If there’s extra space, I take 2x more than my neighbor.”

flex-shrink: “If space is tight, I give up space 3x faster than my neighbor.”

Real-world example: Responsive Navbar
css
Copy
Edit
.navbar {
  display: flex;
}

.logo {
  flex: 0 0 150px; /* never grows, never shrinks, fixed size */
}

.menu {
  flex: 1 1 auto; /* can grow to fill space, can shrink if needed */
}

.search {
  flex: 2 1 200px; /* starts at 200px, grows twice as much as menu */
}
On large screens → search box becomes wider.

On small screens → search shrinks, logo stays fixed.
